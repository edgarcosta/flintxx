Quick building/testing instuctions for Unix (Linux/OSX/*BSD)

Parameters:

WITH_NTL (yes/no) - builds Flint with NTL support

BUILD_TESTING (yes/no) - build tests

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - type of the build

Typically cmake buildig is done in a clean subdirectory:

    mkdir build 
    cd build
    # creates a debug build of Flint without NTL support
    cmake ..
    make -j4    # builds Flint in lib/

    # creates a realease build of Flint with NTL support and tests
    cmake -DWITH_NTL=yes -DBUILD_TESTING=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j4    # builds Flint in lib/
    make test   # runs Flint tests  - this takes a while

At the end of cmake run, it says where the build is located; in some settings it might be in the
main Flint directory, i.e. you would have to 

    cd ..

before running make.
