\chapter{Introduction}

FLINT is a C library of functions for doing number theory. It is highly 
optimised and can be compiled on numerous platforms.  FLINT also has the 
aim of providing support for multicore and multiprocessor computer 
architectures, though we do not yet provide this facility.

FLINT is currently maintained by William Hart of Warwick University in 
the UK. Its main authors are William Hart, Sebastian Pancratz, Fredrik
Johansson, Andy Novocin and David Harvey (no longer active).

FLINT 2 and following should compile on any machine with GCC and a standard 
GNU toolchain, however it is specially optimised for x86 (32 and 64 bit)
machines. As of version 2.0, FLINT required GCC version 2.96 or later, 
MPIR 2.1.1 or later and MPFR 3.0.0 or later.

FLINT is supplied as a set of modules, \code{fmpz}, \code{fmpz_poly}, etc., 
each of which can be linked to a C program making use of their functionality.

All of the functions in FLINT have a corresponding test function provided 
in an appropriately named test file.  For example, the function 
\code{fmpz_poly_add} located in \code{fmpz_poly/add.c} has test code in the 
file \code{fmpz_poly/test/t-add.c}.

\chapter{Building and using FLINT}

The easiest way to use FLINT is to build a shared library.  Simply download 
the FLINT tarball and untar it on your system.

FLINT requires MPIR version 2.1.1 or later and MPFR 3.0.0 or later.

To configure FLINT you must specify where MPIR and MPFR are on
your system. FLINT can work with the libraries installed as usual,
e.g. in \code{/usr/local} or it can work with the libraries built
from source in their standard source trees. 

In the case that a library is installed in say \code{/usr/local}
in the \code{lib} and \code{include} directories as usual, simply
specify the top level location, e.g. \code{/usr/local} when 
configuring FLINT. If a library is built in its source tree,
specify the top level source directory, e.g. \code{/home/user1/mpir/}.

To specify the directories where the libraries reside, you must
pass the directories as parameters to FLINT's configure, e.g.\ 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./configure --with-mpir=/usr/local/ --with-mpfr=/home/user1/mpfr/
\end{lstlisting}
If no directories are specified, FLINT assumes it will find the
libraries it needs in \code{/usr/local}.

Note that FLINT builds static and shared libraries by default. If
you do not require one of these then you may pass 
\code{--disable-static} or \code{--disable-shared} to 
\code{configure}. When running \code{make check} a shared library
is required.

If you intend to install the FLINT library and header files, 
you can specify where they should be placed by passing 
\code{--prefix=path} to configure, where \code{path} is the directory
under which the \code{lib} and \code{include} directories exist into
which you wish to place the FLINT files when it is installed.

Once FLINT is configured, in the main directory of the FLINT directory 
tree simply type:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make
make check
\end{lstlisting}

If you wish to install FLINT, simply type:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make install
\end{lstlisting}

Now to use FLINT, simply include the appropriate header files for 
the FLINT modules you wish to use in your C program.  Then compile 
your program, linking against the FLINT library and MPIR and MPFR 
with the options \code{-lflint -lmpfr -lgmp}.

Note that you may have to set \code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} or equivalent
for your system to let the linker know where to find these libraries.
Please refer to your system documentation for how to do this.

The FLINT make system responds to the standard commands
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make 
make library
make check
make clean
make distclean
make install
\end{lstlisting}

In addition, if you wish to simply check a single module of FLINT you
can pass the option \code{MOD=modname} to \code{make check}. You can 
also pass a list of module names in inverted commas, e.g:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make check MOD=ulong_extras
\end{lstlisting}

If your system supports parallel builds, FLINT will build in parallel,
e.g:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make -j4 check 
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Test code}

Each module of FLINT has an extensive associated test module.  We 
strongly recommend running the test programs before relying on results 
from FLINT on your system. 

To make and run the test programs, simply type:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make check
\end{lstlisting}

in the main FLINT directory after configuring FLINT.

\chapter{Reporting bugs}

The maintainer wishes to be made aware of any and all bugs.  Please send an 
email with your bug report to \url{hart_wb@yahoo.com} or report them on the
FLINT devel list \url{https://groups.google.com/group/flint-devel?hl=en}.

If possible please include details of your system, the version of GCC, 
the versions of MPIR and MPFR as well as precise details of how to 
replicate the bug.

Note that FLINT needs to be linked against version 2.1.1 or later of MPIR,
version 3.0.0 or later of MPFR and must be compiled with gcc version 2.96 
or later.  

\chapter{Contributors}

FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large numnber of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart.

The main authors of FLINT to date have been William Hart, David Harvey (no
longer active), Fredrik Johansson, Sebastian Pancratz and Andy Novocin.

Other significant contributions to FLINT have been made by Jason Papadopoulos,
Gonzalo Tornaria, David Howden, Burcin Erocal, Tom Boothby, Daniel Woodhouse, 
Tomasz Lechowski, Richard Howell-Peak and Peter Shrimpton.

Additional research was contributed by Daniel Scott and Daniel Ellam.

Further patches and bug reports have been made by Michael Abshoff, Didier 
Deshommes, Craig Citro, Timothy Abbot, Carl Witty, Jaap Spies, Kiran 
Kedlaya, William Stein, Robert Bradshaw and many others.

Some code (\code{longlong.h} and \code{clz_tab.c}) has been used from
an LGPL v2+ version of the GMP library. The main author of the GMP 
library is Torbjorn Granlund.

FLINT 2 was a complete rewrite from scratch which began in about 2010.
 
\chapter{Example programs}

FLINT comes with example programs to demonstrate current and future FLINT 
features.  To build the example programs, type:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
make examples
\end{lstlisting}

The example programs are built in the \code{build/examples} directory.
You must set your \code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} or equivalent for the flint, mpir
and mpfr libraries. See your operating system documentation to see how to
set this.

The current example programs are:

\code{delta_qexp}  Computes the first $n$ terms of the delta function, e.g.\ 
\code{build/examples/delta_qexp 1000000} will compute the first one million terms of the 
$q$-expansion of delta.

\code{crt}  Demonstrates the integer Chinese Remainder code, e.g.\ 
\code{build/examples/crt 10382788} will build up the given integer from its value mod various
primes.

\code{multi_crt}  Demonstrates the fast tree version of the integer Chinese Remainder 
code, e.g.\ 
\code{build/examples/multi_crt 100493287498239 13} will build up the given integer from 
its value mod the given number of primes.

\code{stirling_matrix}  Generates Stirling number matrices of the first
and second kind and computes their product, which should come out as the
identity matrix. The matrices are printed to standard output.
For example \code{build/examples/stirling_matrix 10} does this
with 10 by 10 matrices.

\chapter{FLINT macros}

The file \code{flint.h} contains various useful macros.

The macro constant \code{FLINT_BITS} is set at compile time to be the 
number of bits per limb on the machine.  FLINT requires it to be either 
32 or 64 bits.  Other architectures are not currently supported.

The macro constant \code{FLINT_D_BITS} is set at compile time to be the 
number of bits per double on the machine or one less than the number of 
bits per limb, whichever is smaller.  This will have the value 53 or 31 
on currently supported architectures.  Numerous internal functions using 
precomputed inverses only support operands up to \code{FLINT_D_BITS} bits, 
hence the macro.

The macro \code{FLINT_ABS(x)} returns the absolute value of \code{x}
for primitive signed numerical types.  It might fail for least negative 
values such as \code{INT_MIN} and \code{LONG_MIN}.

The macro \code{FLINT_MIN(x, y)} returns the minimum of \code{x} and 
\code{y} for primitive signed or unsigned numerical types.  This macro 
is only safe to use when \code{x} and \code{y} are of the same type, 
to avoid problems with integer promotion.

Similar to the previous macro, \code{FLINT_MAX(x, y)} returns the 
maximum of \code{x} and \code{y}.

The function \code{FLINT_BIT_COUNT(x)} returns the number of binary bits 
required to represent an \code{unsigned long x}.  If \code{x} is zero, 
returns~$0$.

\chapter{fmpz}
\epigraph{Arbitrary precision integers}{}

\section{Introduction}

By default, an \code{fmpz_t} is implemented as an array of \code{fmpz}'s of 
length one to allow passing by reference as one can do with GMP/ MPIR's 
\code{mpz_t} type.  The \code{fmpz_t} type is simply a single limb, though 
the user does not need to be aware of this except in one specific case 
outlined below.

In all respects, \code{fmpz_t}'s act precisely like GMP/ MPIR's 
\code{mpz_t}'s, with automatic memory management, however, in the first 
place only one limb is used to implement them.  Once an \code{fmpz_t} 
overflows a limb then a multiprecision integer is automatically allocated 
and instead of storing the actual integer data the \code{long} which 
implements the type becomes an index into a FLINT wide array of 
\code{mpz_t}'s.

These internal implementation details are not important for the user to 
understand, except for three important things.

Firstly, \code{fmpz_t}'s will be more efficient than \code{mpz_t}'s for 
single limb operations, or more precisely for signed quantities whose 
absolute value does not exceed \code{FLINT_BITS - 2} bits.

Secondly, for small integers that fit into \code{FLINT_BITS - 2} bits 
much less memory will be used than for an \code{mpz_t}.  When very many 
\code{fmpz_t}'s are used, there can be important cache benefits on 
account of this.

Thirdly, it is important to understand how to deal with arrays of 
\code{fmpz_t}'s.  As for \code{mpz_t}'s, there is an underlying type, 
an \code{fmpz}, which can be used to create the array, e.g.\ 
\begin{lstlisting}
fmpz myarr[100];
\end{lstlisting}
Now recall that an \code{fmpz_t} is an array of length one of \code{fmpz}'s.
Thus, a pointer to an \code{fmpz} can be used in place of an \code{fmpz_t}.
For example, to find the sign of the third integer in our array we would 
write 
\begin{lstlisting}
int sign = fmpz_sgn(myarr + 2);
\end{lstlisting}

The \code{fmpz} module provides routines for memory management, basic 
manipulation and basic arithmetic.

Unless otherwise specified, all functions in this section permit aliasing 
between their input arguments and between their input and output 
arguments.

\section{Simple example}

The following example computes the square of the integer $7$ and prints 
the result.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
#include "fmpz.h"
...
fmpz_t x, y;
fmpz_init(x);
fmpz_init(y);
fmpz_set_ui(x, 7);
fmpz_mul(y, x, x);
fmpz_print(x);
printf("^2 = ");
fmpz_print(y);
printf("\n");
fmpz_clear(x);
fmpz_clear(y);
\end{lstlisting}

The output is:
\begin{lstlisting}
7^2 = 49
\end{lstlisting}

We now describe the functions available in the \code{fmpz} module.

\chapter{fmpz\_mat}
\epigraph{Matrices over $\Z$}{}

\section{Introduction}

The \code{fmpz_mat_t} data type represents dense matrices of multiprecision
integers, implemented using \code{fmpz} vectors.

No automatic resizing is performed: in general, the user must provide
matrices of correct dimensions for both input and output variables. Output
variables are \emph{not} allowed to be aliased with input variables unless
otherwise noted.

Matrices are indexed from zero: an $m \times n$ matrix
has rows of index $0,1,\ldots,m-1$ and columns of
index $0,1,\ldots,n-1$. One or both of $m$ and $n$ may be zero.

Elements of a matrix can be read or written using the \code{fmpz_mat_entry}
macro, which returns a reference to the entry at a given row and column index.
This reference can be passed as an input or output \code{fmpz_t} variable to 
any function in the \code{fmpz} module for direct manipulation.

\section{Simple example}
The following example creates the $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$ with
value $2i+j$ at row~$i$ and column~$j$, computes $B = A^2$,
and prints both matrices.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
#include "fmpz.h"
#include "fmpz_mat.h"
...
long i, j;
fmpz_mat_t A;
fmpz_mat_t B;
fmpz_mat_init(A, 2, 2);
fmpz_mat_init(B, 2, 2);
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < 2; j++)
        fmpz_set_ui(fmpz_mat_entry(A, i, j), 2*i+j);
fmpz_mat_mul(B, A, A);
printf("A = \n");
fmpz_mat_print_pretty(A);
printf("A^2 = \n");
fmpz_mat_print_pretty(B);
fmpz_mat_clear(A);
fmpz_mat_clear(B);
\end{lstlisting}

The output is:
\begin{lstlisting}
A = 
[[0 1]
[2 3]]
A^2 = 
[[2 3]
[6 11]]
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{fmpz\_poly}
\epigraph{Polynomials over $\Z$}{}

\section{Introduction}

The \code{fmpz_poly_t} data type represents elements of $\Z[x]$. The 
\code{fmpz_poly} module provides routines for memory management, basic 
arithmetic, and conversions from or to other types.

Each coefficient of an \code{fmpz_poly_t} is an integer of the FLINT 
\code{fmpz_t} type.  There are two advantages of this model.  Firstly, 
the \code{fmpz_t} type is memory managed, so the user can manipulate 
individual coefficients of a polynomial without having to deal with 
tedious memory management.  Secondly, a coefficient of an 
\code{fmpz_poly_t} can be changed without changing the size of any 
of the other coefficients.

Unless otherwise specified, all functions in this section permit aliasing 
between their input arguments and between their input and output arguments.

\section{Simple example}

The following example computes the square of the polynomial $5x^3 - 1$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
#include "fmpz_poly.h"
...
fmpz_poly_t x, y;
fmpz_poly_init(x);
fmpz_poly_init(y);
fmpz_poly_set_coeff_ui(x, 3, 5);
fmpz_poly_set_coeff_si(x, 0, -1);
fmpz_poly_mul(y, x, x);
fmpz_poly_print(x); printf("\n");
fmpz_poly_print(y); printf("\n");
fmpz_poly_clear(x);
fmpz_poly_clear(y);
\end{lstlisting}

The output is:
\begin{lstlisting}
4  -1 0 0 5
7  1 0 0 -10 0 0 25
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Definition of the fmpz\_poly\_t type}

The \code{fmpz_poly_t} type is a typedef for an array of length~1 of 
\code{fmpz_poly_struct}'s.  This permits passing parameters of type 
\code{fmpz_poly_t} by reference in a manner similar to the way GMP integers 
of type \code{mpz_t} can be passed by reference. 

In reality one never deals directly with the \code{struct} and simply deals 
with objects of type \code{fmpz_poly_t}.  For simplicity we will think of an 
\code{fmpz_poly_t} as a \code{struct}, though in practice to access fields 
of this \code{struct}, one needs to dereference first, e.g.\ to access the 
\code{length} field of an \code{fmpz_poly_t} called \code{poly1} one writes 
\code{poly1->length}. 

An \code{fmpz_poly_t} is said to be \emph{normalised} if either 
\code{length} is zero, or if the leading coefficient of the polynomial is 
non-zero.  All \code{fmpz_poly} functions expect their inputs to be 
normalised, and unless otherwise specified they produce output that is 
normalised. 

It is recommended that users do not access the fields of an 
\code{fmpz_poly_t} or its coefficient data directly, but make use of the 
functions designed for this purpose, detailed below.

Functions in \code{fmpz_poly} do all the memory management for the user. 
One does not need to specify the maximum length or number of limbs per 
coefficient in advance before using a polynomial object.  FLINT reallocates 
space automatically as the computation proceeds, if more space is required. 
Each coefficient is also managed separately, being resized as needed, 
independently of the other coefficients.

We now describe the functions available in \code{fmpz_poly}.

\section{Introduction}

The \code{fmpq_poly_t} data type represents elements of $\Q[x]$. The 
\code{fmpq_poly} module provides routines for memory management, basic 
arithmetic, and conversions from or to other types.

A rational polynomial is stored as the quotient of an integer polynomial 
and an integer denominator.  To be more precise, the coefficient vector 
of the numerator can be accessed with the function \code{fmpq_poly_numref()} 
and the denominator with \code{fmpq_poly_denref()}.  Although one can 
construct use cases in which a representation as a list of rational 
coefficients would be beneficial, the choice made here is typically 
more efficient.

We can obtain a unique representation based on this choice by enforcing, 
for non-zero polynomials, that the numerator and denominator are coprime 
and that the denominator is positive.  The unique representation of the 
zero polynomial is chosen as $0/1$.

Similar to the situation in the \code{fmpz_poly_t} case, an 
\code{fmpq_poly_t} object also has a \code{length} parameter, which 
denotes the length of the vector of coefficients of the numerator. 
We say a polynomial is \emph{normalised} either if this length is zero 
or if the leading coefficient is non-zero.

We say a polynomial is in \emph{canonical} form if it is given in the 
unique representation discussed above and normalised.

The functions provided in this module roughly fall into two categories:

On the one hand, there are functions mainly provided for the user, whose 
names do not begin with an underscore.  These typically operate on 
polynomials of type \code{fmpq_poly_t} in canonical form and, unless 
specified otherwise, permit aliasing between their input arguments and 
between their output arguments.

On the other hand, there are versions of these functions whose names are 
prefixed with a single underscore.  These typically operate on polynomials 
given in the form of a triple of object of types \code{fmpz *}, 
\code{fmpz_t}, and \code{long}, containing the numerator, denominator and 
length, respectively.  In general, these functions expect their input to 
be normalised, i.e.\ they do not allow zero padding, and to be in lowest 
terms, and they do not allow their input and output arguments to be aliased.

\section{Introduction}

An \code{nmod_mat_t} represents a matrix of integers modulo $n$, for any 
non-zero $n$ that fits in a single limb, up to $2^{32}-1$ or $2^{64}-1$. The
implementation uses functions and data types of the \code{nmod_vec} module
for low-level operations.

One or both dimensions of a matrix may be zero.

Except where otherwise noted, it is assumed all entries in input
data are already reduced in the range $[0, n)$. It is also assumed that
all arguments have the same modulus.

Functions that require the modulus to be a prime number document this
requirement explicitly.
